- `repay_borrow_ratio` shows extreme outliers (handled by log-scaling).
- Liquidation is low for most users, but a few have many.

## Score Distribution
- Most scores were **very low**.
- A few wallets had very high scores due to perfect repay/deposit behavior.

## Risk Classification

- Better normalization for extreme ratios may help.

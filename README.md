# üè¶ Wallet Credit Score Model

This project presents a **DeFi wallet credit scoring model** designed to analyze user wallet behavior on the blockchain and assign a credit score along with a risk label (`High Risk`, `Medium Risk`, or `Low Risk`). The scoring is based on on-chain transaction activity and wallet engagement metrics.

---

## üìå Problem Statement

Given user wallet transaction data on a DeFi platform, build a **Credit Scoring System** to:
- Calculate a **credit score** based on transaction behavior.
- Classify each wallet into **risk categories**.
- Output the final result as a CSV file with `wallet`, `score`, and `risk_label`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Scikit-learn** (for scaling)
- **Git/GitHub**

| liquidation_count    | Times liquidated                                          |
| total_value_usd      | Total USD value transacted                                |
| active_days          | Days active on platform                                   |
| repay_borrow_ratio   | Ratio of repay_count to borrow_count                      |

## üßÆ Scoring Formula

```python
score = (
    repay_borrow_ratio * 400 +
    deposit_count * 0.5 +
    active_days * 2 -
    liquidation_count * 100
)


The score is then scaled to the range [0, 1000] using MinMaxScaler.

Based on the score, wallets are labeled:

Credit Score	     Risk Label
< 100	             High Risk
100‚Äì249            Medium Risk
‚â• 250	             Low Risk
